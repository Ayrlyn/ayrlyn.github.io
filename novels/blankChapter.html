                                "You, you are perfect."<br><br>
                                The student looked up from his desk in the university library. Another student was
                                standing in front of him, head tilted to one side and examining him like he was a thing
                                under a microscope. She was easily taller than he was, with long straight jet-black hair
                                bound back and braided, and the most unbelievably piercing blue eyes examining him from
                                behind circular glasses.<br><br>
                                She crossed her arms when she saw she had his attention and continued.<br><br>
                                “You are not terrible looking, you are quiet and best of all, you do not stare at others
                                like they are some kind of prize or trophy. A perfect little loser.” Her tone was as
                                blunt as her words.<br><br>
                                This was a bizarre introduction, and the recipient had no idea where it was supposed to
                                be going. Still, it was fascinating in its own right, and he wanted to see what the
                                point of it all was. They had never met so he was clueless as to where any of this was
                                coming from. Not that he felt he could really argue with the 'loser' part.<br><br>
                                “I am not serious about the loser part.” She smiled but there was no warmth in it, “Here
                                is the deal. You are now my pretend boyfriend. Nothing real, nothing complicated. Just a
                                convenient 'fuck-off' sign for all the idiots out there. You are safe and you are
                                non-threatening, and I am not so far out of your league as to make this look absurd.
                                Like I said, you are perfect."<br><br>
                                Students came and went around them with a few casting curious glances their way. They
                                both ignored them, watching each other. Those piercing blue eyes continued to
                                stare.<br><br>
                                “Do not get any ideas, though. You are here for my benefit. That means contact is
                                limited to some holding hands and the occasional hug but only when there are enough
                                people around to make it worthwhile. Remember, the point is to convince everyone that I
                                am unavailable. Of course, there will be no kissing and definitely no sex."<br><br>
                                The clock chimed the hour, and the space began to empty as most people left for their
                                next lecture.<br><br>
                                “Okay.” To the young man's surprise, he was the one saying it. He tore a strip of paper
                                and wrote on it. “Here's my number, let me know when and where to be and I'll be
                                there.”<br><br>
                                Her eyes widened by a fraction, and she looked almost amused for a second.<br><br>
                                “Just like that? No bargaining for anything in return?”<br><br>
                                “Just like that.” He shrugged.<br><br>
                                “See, I knew you were perfect. I will text you. See you later, nerd.” She turned and
                                swept away.<br><br>
                                “It's Wren.” He called after her and received her middle finger in response.<br><br>
                                Wren leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. He did not really know why he
                                had agreed to this. Then again, he was single, not particularly busy most days and this
                                promised to be interesting if nothing else. What did a relationship that was for the
                                benefit of the surrounding crowd look like?<br><br>
                                His phone chimed and he opened the messenger.<br><br>
                                <i>Now you have my number, too. Do not give it out, <s>Wren</s> nerd. -Lamia.</i>
