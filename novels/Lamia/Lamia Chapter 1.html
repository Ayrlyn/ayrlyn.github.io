                                Wren tried to focus on his textbooks. A minute went buy and he realised he had not absorbed a word. His gaze bounced off of the page, and he tried to close his eyes and refocus. It was not happening.<br><br>
                                What did a relationship that was for the benefit of the surrounding crowd look like?<br><br>
                                Finding a fresh piece of paper, he started to take notes. Start by removing the emotional component to dating. Where did that leave them? With a series of physical actions that were intended to express various levels of affection. These actions were observable by other people, but some were more overt than others.<br><br>
                                Wren's phone chimed, startling him. He looked at his page of notes. It was covered in lists, crossed out sections, arrows. Maybe he would try and clean it up later.<br><br>
                                <i>Meet me outside the library. 5 minutes.</i><br><br>
                                The new fake-boyfriend quickly packed up and hurried outside. Lamia was waiting for him and as soon as she saw him coming, she started walking. Wren caught up and fall in line beside her. A hand was offered, more in command than invitation, and he took it. Her skin was cool.<br><br>
                                The trees were turning in the inner courtyard, but the true cold had not hit them yet. For now, everyone could enjoy both the remaining warmth and clear skies.<br><br>
                                “All right nerd, we are taking a loop around the campus. We want eyes on us so we will stick to the most public places got it?” She sounded like she was talking about the weather.<br><br>
                                “Got it.” And they continued in silence for a time. It was not exactly a comfortable silence, but it was not so bad either.<br><br>
                                “We should turn left here. There is a secluded memorial garden around the corner.” Wren spoke quickly to forestall the inevitable objection, “No-one ever goes into the garden. However, everyone in the surrounding buildings has a perfect view of whoever is in there. To observers, it will look like we're trying to steal a private romantic moment.”<br><br>
                                Lamia said nothing for a little while and Wren grew nervous.<br><br>
                                “Not bad. Fine, we will go.” The same neutral tone.<br><br>
                                They entered the garden and sat together on one of the benches. Students moved between classes all around. Many glanced their way, some even doing a visible double-take and stopping briefly. Wren was happy to be right but also wondered who exactly he was sitting with. It was still a good opportunity. He turned to face her a little more and reached over so that both of his hands held one of hers.<br><br>
                                “I hope you are not getting any ideas here, nerd.” There was no heat in her voice at least.<br><br>
                                “Just putting on a show for your adoring fans, Lamia.” Wren moved his head in the direction of the students who had stopped. From what he could tell, some were staring in open interest.<br><br>
                                “Hah look at that. You know, you are not too bad for a loser.” This time, she did not sound like she meant the loser thing. At least Wren hoped so.<br><br>
                                “I aim to please.” He said.<br><br>
                                Lamia's expression shifted slightly, and she regarded Wren seriously for a moment.<br><br>
                                “You are seriously thinking about this.” As she said it, there was a hint of something like surprise in her voice, “You are putting in effort.”<br><br>
                                “That's right.” He responded and hoped she would not ask why.<br><br>
                                “Why?” Same flat tone. Same brilliant eyes.<br><br>
                                “Because it's interesting. We're…” Wren struggled for a word, “… I don't know the word. Co-conspirators? No that's not it.  Anyway, no-one walks up to a stranger and tells them that they are fake dating without a good reason.”<br><br>
                                He did not mention that it had been less than an hour and he already found her fascinating. The whole exercise promised to be interesting if nothing else. He absolutely did not mention the other thing.<br><br>
                                “And then you will ditch our agreement when you get bored.” She said that with absolute certainty.<br><br>
                                “Lamia.” Wren looked her directly in the eye, as difficult as that was. “I am going to be real with you for a second then you can go back to calling me a nerd. I might have agreed to this quickly, but I did not do so lightly. So long as you want a fake boyfriend, I'm here.”<br><br>
                                Lamia gave him a long appraising look for the second time in ten minutes. Wren had no idea what was going on in her head at all.<br><br>
                                “All right.” And a second later, “Nerd. Come on, that is enough of a show for the morons in the peanut gallery.”<br><br>
                                They continued their rounds for a time.  Wren noticed that everywhere they went Lamia drew a glance or two. He was hardly walking with a celebrity, but she was definitely a known quantity to some.<br><br>
                                “You're kind of famous around here.” He commented.<br><br>
                                “Like you do not know.” She glanced at him, and he shrugged.<br><br>
                                “I really don't.” It was true.<br><br>
                                “So, when you agreed to this,” Wren thought she was having a hard time believing him, “You really did it with no idea who I am. We are complete strangers.”<br><br>
                                “Yeah, pretty much.” Wren smiled at her, partly for the look of the thing, and partly because he felt like he wanted to.<br><br>
                                “Sure.” She sounded like she was not sure if she believed her new fake partner or not. “Well, even if you truly do not know I am sure you will find out soon.”<br><br>
                                Wren tried not to think too hard about how ominous that sounded.
