                                Ten minutes to seven and Wren was waiting outside of Qué Bonita, bouquet in hand. He was full of nervous energy and then berated himself. It was not a date. Lamia was not his girlfriend. He still worried that she would not like the flowers.<br><br>
                                “Wren?” The voice sounded uncertain. Lamia did not do uncertain and so this could not be her. Wren turned around and, impossibly, it was Lamia.<br><br>
                                They stood for a moment openly staring at each other. She was wearing a black dress made of a material so dark that it looked like someone had cut a Lamia-shaped hole in reality. Instead of the usual ponytail, her hair cascaded about her shoulders in waves. Somehow, she had woven silver threads through it.<br><br>
                                She was looking at her supposed boyfriend with unmasked surprise. Wren was wearing heeled boots, tight black trousers, a royal blue shirt with silver-embroidered sleeves, and a white waistcoat. His hair was carefully styled, make-up carefully applied. Finally, Wren was making an effort to actually stand properly. He had surprised himself at home.<br><br>
                                Of course, Lamia recovered first.<br><br>
                                “That is quite the improvement.” She noted cooly, “You should keep it up every day. Not the clothes, too flashy.”<br><br>
                                “You look beautiful.” He offered her the flowers.<br><br>
                                “Flowers? Seriously?” She definitely did not approve.<br><br>
                                “Take them. They're not for you.” She did so but she still looked unhappy about it.<br><br>
                                They went inside and were shown to a table by the window. Once they were alone, he picked the flowers up from where Lamia had laid them and repositioned them next to the window, turning them a little until he thought they were just right.<br><br>
                                “There. Now anyone who walks past and happens to see it will be in no doubt. Flowers mean date.” Then again, Wren thought that anyone who walked past and saw Lamia right now would very likely be completely oblivious to everything else until they were hit by a car.<br><br>
                                “No roses?” She asked and there was the ghost of a smile dancing around her mouth.<br><br>
                                “No roses.” He confirmed and did not elaborate.<br><br>
                                The waiter brought menus, and they ordered drinks. He stared at Wren with open interest which was a first but also irritating.<br><br>
                                “You could ask for his number.” Lamia dryly commented.<br><br>
                                “No way.” Wren responded, “I'm obviously on a date here. Talk about inappropriate.”<br><br>
                                If they had thought the waiter was bad, the waitress was in a league of her own. She was completely flustered around Lamia, nearly spilling a drink had Lamia not reached out to steady the glass with lightning reflexes. The waitress mumbled apologies and fled with a scarlet face.<br><br>
                                “You could ask for her number.” Wren said.<br><br>
                                “No way.” She responded and they shared a smile.<br><br>
                                Their food arrived and was excellent. It came from a remote archipelago so distant as to be practically independent from the mainland. They fell into the comfortable silence of two people enjoying a good meal together.<br><br>
                                “Are you free tomorrow evening?” Lamia asked and Wren nodded.<br><br>
                                “Sure, what did you have in mind?” He said.<br><br>
                                “I would like you to meet me. I will text you the address later.” Wren felt there was something strange there, but he did not know why.<br><br>
                                The rest of the meal passed pleasantly enough. Lamia insisted they split the bill and after all the shopping earlier, even with Moneta's discount, Wren agreed easily. They left and walked together arm in arm. It was a pleasant evening, the sky was mostly clear and while there was a breeze it was not too chill.<br><br>
                                A few people were walking towards them, and the strangers seemed to be pointing and whispering to each other. They did not look like university students but if they did not know Lamia it was hard to imagine why they would be interested. As they drew abreast, Wren caught a few fragments of their conversation.<br><br>
                                “… a lovely couple…”<br><br>
                                “… reminds me…”<br><br>
                                “…she's…beautiful…”<br><br>
                                “…young love…”<br><br>
                                It made sense, their performance should be just as effective on people who had no idea who we were, maybe even more so.<br><br>
                                “Your fanbase is growing, Lamia.” Wren said.<br><br>
                                “Our fanbase, Wren.” She replied. “Ours.”
