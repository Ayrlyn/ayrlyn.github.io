                                Wren felt a little strange not meeting Lamia after class, but he really needed the extra
                                time before their dinner date.<br><br>
                                “Shit!” He scrambled to pick up his phone.<br><br>
                                He almost dropped it immediately in his haste to call Qué Bonita. Yes, they had tables
                                that night. Yes, seven o'clock was possible. The table was confirmed in Wren's name. He
                                cursed again, softly this time. He should have done that the previous day.<br><br>
                                First stop was a florist. Wren wandered through the shop browsing bouquets of various
                                styles. It could be a bad move considering the whole Nyle incident. He had a plan,
                                though. They were not for Lamia.<br><br>
                                “Can I help you sir?” A bubbly clerk was smiling that professional smile universal to
                                the role.<br><br>
                                “I have a date tonight with a very unique woman.” He said and hoped the clerk would not
                                suggest roses.<br><br>
                                “Hmm, unique? Let me guess, red roses won't cut it?” Wren appreciated the catch.<br><br>
                                “Yeah. The colours I have in mind are black, white, and the most brilliant azure you can
                                imagine.” Especially the azure.<br><br>
                                “What about orchids? They represent exotic beauty and strength, and we have some black
                                ones for a small bouquet.” That sounded like a good idea.<br><br>
                                “A small bouquet is definitely more her style and black orchids sound good.” A pad and
                                pencil were produced. A note made.<br><br>
                                “Okay, well let's see we have some white carnations for purity and good luck?” Wren
                                shook his head. Another note.<br><br>
                                “Galdiolus. Strength of character.” Yes, that.<br><br>
                                “Perfect.” Note.<br><br>
                                “All right, you said azure? What about blue snapdragons. That's graciousness and
                                strength.” Wren nodded, those obviously screamed Lamia.<br><br>
                                “Right, those are your statement flowers. You can leave me to figure out the rest. The
                                fillers and the greenery, is that okay?” Wren was happy to leave that part to the
                                expert.<br><br>
                                “Yes, thank you. And thanks for helping pick these out for me.” He had exotic beauty,
                                strength, strength of character, graciousness, strength again. That was a lot of
                                strength. Was it too much? Wren had to remind himself that this was a fake date and the
                                flowers were not for Lamia.<br><br>
                                “That's what I'm here for.” The clerk was quickly and expertly putting the bouquet
                                together and to Wren's untrained eye it looked really good.<br><br>
                                “You know, you don't have anything in here that says love or dedication or any of the
                                traditional stuff.” The clerk said hesitantly, “Are you sure you don't want something
                                like that?”<br><br>
                                “Positive, getting a bouquet is already kind of a risk without including something like
                                a declaration of love.” Wren got a strange look for that one.<br><br>
                                “Well, best of luck to you sir.” The clerk said while the other man paid. “Uhm, I know
                                it's really not my place but… Are you going to do something about…. You know?”<br><br>
                                He looked Wren up and down and he flushed, annoyed.<br><br>
                                “Yes, thank you. It's my next stop.” His voice was cold, and the clerk looked
                                uncomfortable. Why did this keep happening all of a sudden?<br><br>
                                “I'm sorry sir. I know it's really out of line. It's just that, well.” He gestured, “It
                                doesn't have to be this way.”<br><br>
                                Wren had no idea what that meant. He looked after himself. He was fit. What was so
                                terrible?<br><br>
                                The next stop was a clothing store. Wren hoped they had someone skilled. He clearly
                                needed it.<br><br>
                                Along the way he did the sums in his head. The bouquet had cost more than he hoped and
                                less than he had feared. So long as the new clothing was not too bad, he would be able
                                to make it work.<br><br>
                                The fashion disaster found a small store and went inside. Bigger stores advertised
                                personal shopping assistants but the prices on the clothes and makeup were inflated to
                                compensate. There was a staff member nearby with her back to him sorting through a rack
                                of jeans, so he approached her. Short dark green hair, he had seen that recently. 
                                Something tickled at the back of Wren's mind.<br><br>
                                “Hi, I was wondering if you could help me.” Wren said.<br><br>
                                “Of course!” She turned with that same professional smile the florist had used except
                                that it shattered as soon as she saw him to be replaced by a look of panic. He knew her
                                from somewhere and it took him a second to get it. She was one of Nyle's friends, the
                                one who said 'sorry' at the end of the previous day's farce.<br><br>
                                “Well, this is awkward.” Wren said for lack of anything better.<br><br>
                                “Yeah. Uhm. Look I'm, like, sorry about yesterday. Nyle was being an arse, but I promise
                                he's not actually that bad.” Wren found that hard to believe.<br><br>
                                “You'll forgive me if I reserve judgement on that one.” He responded and Lamia would
                                have been proud at just how neutral he kept his voice.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, I'm not surprised.” She looked uncomfortable, “I'm Moneta and I can, like, get
                                someone else to help you if you want.”<br><br>
                                After a moment's thought, her new customer offered his hand in introduction. The message
                                was clear. Let us forget yesterday and start here. Moneta looked startled but she took
                                it and kissed it before offering hers so he could do the same.<br><br>
                                “I need your help.” Her offer of an alternative person was ignored.<br><br>
                                “Yeah?” Her eyes caught the bouquet he was holding and she perked up, “Do you have,
                                like, a date with Lamia? That's so sweet. But flowers? Are you sure? You know what
                                happened to Nyle, right?"<br><br>
                                “I'm not Nyle.” He said.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, that was clear from yesterday. Hey, those are, like, kind of cute. No roses?” She
                                asked.<br><br>
                                “Like I said, I'm not Nyle.” She laughed a little.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, these are nice. I know that's, like, an orchid or something but not the others.
                                Wait, you didn't buy this pre-made did you. This was, like, custom made by a florist?”<br><br>
                                “I did, right before coming here.” Wren felt a little self-conscious admitting it.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, these are not, random are they.” Moneta looked closer, “You actually, like, chose
                                them for their meanings. It's not just the colours, which are really nice by the way.”<br><br>
                                “Yeah.” What else could he say?<br><br>
                                “Yeah, wow. I kind of wish I had, like, found you before Lamia did. Well, you not being,
                                like, a woman is an issue but still.” That was probably the nicest thing anyone had said
                                to Wren since the venture started. He blushed.<br><br>
                                “Thank you. The thing is, the florist made a comment about my appearance and after Nyle
                                and Lamia made similar comments, I'm realising I need help.” He did not like admitting
                                it, but it was clearly a universally held opinion.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, I can, definitely help you.” She paused clearly confused, “Wait, Lamia?”<br><br>
                                Wren shrugged. He could not exactly explain their relationship to a stranger. Especially
                                when that person was a friend of Nyle's. Fake dating or real, he still needed help.<br><br>
                                “She's honest.” He said.<br><br>
                                “Yeah but, like, she's your girlfriend.” Moneta looked disapproving.<br><br>
                                “She's Lamia.” Not that it mattered since it was all fake anyway. Moneta seemed offended
                                on his behalf which felt nice.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, okay, like, we're starting with clothes. Yours, suck.” That hurt. “You're just a
                                shapeless bag, Wren. Like, I can't really tell anything about your body. You've got to
                                have good features, everyone does, so, show yours off.”<br><br>
                                That made sense. Wren bought plain, comfortable and hardwearing. It had to last. A
                                measuring tape was produced.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, it's not just the clothes though.” Moneta spoke as she worked, “Like, everything
                                about the way you hold yourself screams 'leave me alone'. Not hot.”<br><br>
                                That was a disturbing comment. Wren started to think back on his many failures but was
                                soon sent to the changing room with some pairs of jeans and t-shirts.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, we've got to, like, get a look at what we're working with here.” Moneta was all
                                business now. “Measurements are only part of the puzzle.”<br><br>
                                Her customer emerged wearing a new outfit pulling at the hem of the t-shirt. He felt
                                very strange with clothes that actually fit.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, like, Wren what have you been doing?” Moneta asked and he was genuinely confused.<br><br>
                                “What?” He felt like he was screwing that part up, too.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, you're not, like, hiding a superhero physique but, like, you're clearly in decent
                                shape.” Moneta was looking his up in down in a way that was completely foreign to him,
                                “Showing it off won't kill you.”<br><br>
                                Wren struggled with the compliments. He wanted to push them aside, play them off as
                                nothing. Then he had an inkling. That behaviour was part of the problem.<br><br>
                                “Okay, so what do I do with it?” He asked.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, we have some options. Come on.” She led him to another part of the store.<br><br>
                                With Moneta's help he put together a few outfits. Wren had intended to buy one outfit
                                for the date. Somehow, he was carrying several.<br><br>
                                They chatted the whole time. Moneta made a half-hearted attempt to talk up Nyle but only
                                solidified Wren's opinion. Apparently, he was dashing and romantic. He sounded like an
                                essentialist moron.<br><br>
                                “Okay, then would you date him, if he were a woman?” Wren eventually asked.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, no way.” Came the reflexive response. Moneta seemed surprised, and Nyle was not
                                brought up again.<br><br>
                                The conversation inevitably turned to Lamia.<br><br>
                                “How did you convince her to go out with you?” Moneta asked. Of course, she had to be
                                curious how Wren had succeeded where Nyle failed.<br><br>
                                “I didn't.” He admitted. He and Lamia had not worked out an official story, “She asked
                                me. Well, she told me.”<br><br>
                                “Yeah? Really?” Moneta seemed genuinely surprised, “Telling you certainly sounds like
                                Lamia. I guess I never thought of her as the type to be, like, looking for someone. Not
                                that I really know her that well.”<br><br>
                                Mercifully, Wren did not have to elaborate.<br><br>
                                Makeup was a much simpler affair. The fashion was leaning towards faux-natural, so
                                it was just a matter of finding the right shade of BB Cream and pairing it with a subtle
                                lip stain and eyeliner. Wren had done this part before as he was not completely
                                hopeless.<br><br>
                                They walked to the till and Moneta totalled up the purchases. The price made Wren wince.
                                He told himself that most of it was for him, not Lamia. He would make it work.<br><br>
                                Once Wren paid, he went to pocket the receipt, and something caught his eye. The total
                                was completely wrong. Staff discount, only twenty percent of what it should have been.
                                Wren looked up at Moneta. She winked.<br><br>
                                “Good luck on your date, Wren.”
