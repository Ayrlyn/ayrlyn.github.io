                                Saturday. There were no classes and no Lamia until the evening. Wren checked his phone just to be sure but there was nothing. He still did not know where he was going that night. Leaving the phone, he went to the kitchen and started brewing a pot of coffee. He thought about going to the library. Normally, he took weekends off studying, but he had been distracted lately.<br><br>
                                Wren's phone buzzed from the next room, and he hurried to see who it was.<br><br>
                                <i>Dude, Heights Café soon as you can.</i><br><br>
                                Brawne. Right, Wren had not said anything to his best friend since fake dating Lamia. He had no idea what to do. He had forgotten to talk to Lamia about what their story was supposed to be, yet again.<br><br>
                                <i>Hey, my best friend is meeting me for coffee soon. I keep meaning to ask what our official story is meant to be, anything I need to make sure to say or avoid?</i><br><br>
                                The message might not be seen by Lamia in time. Wren thought he could wing it again. However, talking to a shop clerk who did not know him and his best friend were two very different things. He would just make it work.<br><br>
                                Coffee forgotten, Wren made it to front door and paused. He looked down at his clothes, shapeless, nondescript and sighed. He quickly changed into one of the new outfits he had purchased. Nothing flashy like the previous night, just something that actually fit nicely. Next, hair and makeup, remember good posture, and then he could leave.<br><br>
                                <i>On my way.</i><br><br>
                                <i>You better be, I know where you live.</i><br><br>
                                Heights Café had once been the busiest hangout spot in the area before losing a lot of its customers to franchised cafés with a wider assortment of complicated offerings. Now those cafés were falling out of favour as people grew tired of the frills and started demanded higher quality coffee. Heights had always worked hard in that department and sprang on the opportunity. It had not reclaimed its previous level of popularity, but it was getting there.<br><br>
                                Inside, it was doing a steady trade and there was a low murmur of conversation. Seeing Brawne, Wren walked over to their table. Along the way, someone waving caught his attention. It was Moneta. She made a gesture and mouthed something he was pretty sure was supposed to mean ‘How did it go?’ The fraud gave her a thumbs up and she flashed a heart with her hands before returning her attention to her table.<br><br>
                                Brawne saw the exchange and turned to look at Moneta as well, frowning slightly. Wren sat down opposite them, and they turned back to him. Amber eyes regarded him underneath a crown of spiky blonde hair. Everything about them radiated strength and power.<br><br>
                                “Sorry dude,” They said, “You can't sit there. I'm waiting for my friend, Wren.”<br><br>
                                “Very funny.” The friend in question said.<br><br>
                                “No, seriously dude. Wren dresses like shit, doesn't have a girlfriend and definitely doesn’t get thrown fucking heart emojis by random girls in cafés.” Wren flinched internally. Again, with the appearance thing and Brawne, too. He silently resolved to burn all his old things and go back to Moneta for more clothes. At least, when he could afford to.<br><br>
                                “It's been a weird few days.” He started, “Basically- “<br><br>
                                Brawne held up a hand.<br><br>
                                “Nah man, we're doing this right.” They said, “That means I'm going up there and getting us some coffees. I'm paying so you're paying me back by talking. Got it?”<br><br>
                                “Got it.” He said, “Thanks Brawne.”<br><br>
                                They left Wren at the table, and he checked his phone hoping to have received some guidance or instruction from Lamia. Nothing. That was fine, he could stick to the truth without breaking Lamia's trust. Once they 'broke up' he would tell Brawne.<br><br>
                                “Alrighty, two coffees. Now you may begin.” Brawne handed Wren a steaming mug and he took a small sip before starting.<br><br>
                                “Lamia and I were strangers, but three days ago she comes up to me. Says that she's noticed me around and liked that I was quiet, unobtrusive and that I didn't look at others like prizes or trophies. So, she says we're dating now, and we would see how it works out.” Wren hoped it was good enough. That was what happened more or less.<br><br>
                                “Dude, you're telling me Lamia asked you out?” Brawne looked impressed.<br><br>
                                “Not exactly.” Wren admitted, “She told me we were together, and I agreed.”<br><br>
                                Brawne outright laughed at that one.<br><br>
                                “Yeah dude, that sounds like you. Sounds like her too from what I hear. 'Told you that you were together' man that's peak.” Wren waited for them to get over it before continuing.<br><br>
                                “Glad you approve.” He said, “Anyway, it's only been a few days, but things are going well, really well so far.”<br><br>
                                “Uhuh.” Brawne leaned back and cast a critical eye over their friend, “So where does your makeover fit into it?”<br><br>
                                “Well, Lamia and I had a dinner date last night. Since dating her, I had started to get all these comments about my looks. Seriously, it was like the whole world was in on it. Moneta,” Wren gestured towards the other table, “Works in the shop where I bought these. She helped me pick them out and get my new makeup and so on.”<br><br>
                                “Sure, but why's she invested in you?” Brawne asked.<br><br>
                                “She's a friend of Nyle's.” Wren responded and their eyes widened.<br><br>
                                “You met Nyle? He came after you?” Knowing Brawne they would go right after him in turn depending on what Wren said here.<br><br>
                                “Kind of. Lamia and I were out for ice-cream together. Nyle happened to be there, and he made a big scene.” He grimaced, “What an arsehole. Called Lamia a bitch and a snake. Had this whole absurd thing going on about how she should be his and how he was her knight. I couldn't believe a real person was saying something so stupid. Did you know he made some big public thing out of asking her out, complete with rose bouquet?”<br><br>
                                “Yeah dude, guy's a total shit. Not too sure about this Moneta if she's a friend of his.” Something struck them, “People have been saying that someone called Nyle out on his shit in public a couple of days ago. That must have been what you're talking about. Dude this is great, you're peak.”<br><br>
                                Wren had no idea people had been talking about that incident after the fact. It made sense. Everything he and Lamia did was very public for that exact reason. Finding evidence that it was actually working disconcerted him.<br><br>
                                “That's basically it.” Wren shrugged, “It's going well and we're meeting up again tonight.”<br><br>
                                “Nah that's not it.” Brawne leaned towards him, “That's the story sure. I have questions dude so settle in. First off, how do you feel about the whole snake hunting thing?”<br><br>
                                “Snake hunting?” Wren asked and a strange cold feeling settled in his stomach. 'You're such a snake', Nyle's words.<br><br>
                                “Come on dude. Like you don't know.” Brawne made a dismissive gesture.<br><br>
                                “Brawne.” Wren found he could not speak normally. His voice came out wrong and flat. “What the fuck is 'snake hunting'?”<br><br>
                                “Dude. Man. You don't know? I thought everyone knew.” They gave their ignorant friend a look he could not decipher.<br><br>
                                “I'm not telling you,” They immediately put up a hand as Wren opened his mouth to object. “No dude, listen. This is Lamia's thing. If you had already heard about it through gossip that's one thing. It's hers to share and you have to respect that. So don't ask me and don't go asking other random people either. Don't ask Lamia either, if she hasn't told you then you better damn well respect her wishes got it?”<br><br>
                                Wren nodded reluctantly remembering how Lamia had assumed he knew who she was at the beginning.<br><br>
                                “Alright dude we're dropping that one and I mean it about not asking her.” Wren nodded again, more firmly and Brawne seemed satisfied. “Good. So, was it worth the wait?”<br><br>
                                Wren picked up his cup of coffee and feigned nonchalance.<br><br>
                                “Was what worth the wait?” Of course, he knew what they meant. He had just hoped it would not come up.<br><br>
                                “Man, don't play dumb. Was it worth the wait to start dating? You talk like this shit is all easy and natural for you, but I know you have never had a girlfriend before.” Wren flinched and stared into his cup, and there was an uncomfortable pause before Brawne continued. “Dude, I'm sorry. That came out super harsh. It's just I know you had so many years taken away from you. I just want you to be happy.”<br><br>
                                “I was waiting for the right person.” Wren's voice was soft and when he said it then, the words did not sound as reasonable as it had the years before. It was also a complete lie. He refused to think about the lost years.<br><br>
                                “Is she it, then? Is Lamia the right one?” He knew this came from a place of genuine concern.<br><br>
                                Until then Wren had managed to avoid lying outright. He did not like lying to Brawne and realised he was incapable of it. Not like this. Not about this. He would tell them the truth, and they would go from there.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, Brawne. She is beyond incredible, and I am falling for her.” Brawne looked really happy for their best friend whose mind was suddenly total chaos.<br><br>
                                Wren had the told the truth. That had been his intent, and he had done it. He was falling for Lamia. He was really falling for Lamia. That was a major problem.<br><br>
                                “Dude, thank the gods. Waiting is all noble or something but I'm so happy you put yourself out there. Well from what you said Lamia came in and hauled you out but whatever.” He was only half aware of Brawne's words. He did not know what to do with this revelation. If Lamia found out, she would kill him.<br><br>
                                “So happy you're not saying you're in love or some shit either. Way too early for that crap and it could only end one way.” Brawne continued, oblivious.<br><br>
                                “Hey Wren, mind if I, like, join you both?” He looked up. Moneta was standing at their table. He gestured to the empty seat, and she took it. The confused man wanted to get out and sort out his thoughts. He knew he was not getting the chance.<br><br>
                                “Moneta, Brawne. Brawne, Moneta.” They kissed the backs of each other's hands in greeting.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, sorry but everyone left, and I had to come and find out how the date went.” Moneta put her elbows on the table and rested her head in her hands. “Did she like the flowers?”<br><br>
                                Wren noticed her eyes were also blue, just lighter and softer than Lamia's brilliant azure.<br><br>
                                “Dude, you got Lamia flowers?” Brawne asked.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, I know right? But you should have seen the bouquet. Like, Wren comes into the shop with this bouquet and it's all black, white, and blue. Not a rose in sight. Then, he admits that he's, like, bought them from a florist and they all have, like, special meanings picked out for Lamia.” She shook her head, and Wren realised that he should have realised that he had feelings for Lamia the day before, if not earlier.<br><br>
                                “Dude, you're peak. You know that? Wow.” Brawne is laughing, “I was worried about this being your first, but I think you'll be fine. A fucking florist dude.”<br><br>
                                “Yeah? First?” Moneta asked looking between them and Wren glare at Brawne who had the decency to look embarrassed.<br><br>
                                “Lamia is my first romantic partner of any kind.” He admitted. “Ever.”<br><br>
                                “Yeah? Like really?” He did not like the way she was looking at him.<br><br>
                                “I was waiting for the right person.” Wren thought he sounded outright pathetic then. Not that the truth would help with that. He forged ahead.<br><br>
                                “The flowers did not go over poorly.” He said, “I don't think she liked them at first, but she came around pretty quickly.”<br><br>
                                “What did they mean, man? Moneta said you picked out special ones.” Brawne asked and Moneta nodded enthusiastically.<br><br>
                                “Let's see.” He struggled to remember having not written it down, “There was some overlap, but we had strength, grace, strength of character and… serenity maybe?”<br><br>
                                “Dude, nothing said love or devotion or any of that?” Brawne sounded disbelieving.<br><br>
                                “No look…” Wren hesitated while trying to put his feelings into words. “Giving flowers like that doesn't say anything. Not really. Telling someone you're already with that you like them? That you're devoted to them? Good I should hope so. When I bought Lamia those flowers it was meant to be express how I feel about her, what makes her special to me. If your partner is specifically into roses or carnations or whatever then great buy those. I am not dating that person, I'm dating Lamia, and she is everything I said in that bouquet and more.”<br><br>
                                Those last few works awkwardly trailed out. Moneta was pointing at him with one hand and excitedly punching Brawne with the other.<br><br>
                                “Like, he did it again! That's what the knight speech was like.” She seemed genuinely happy.<br><br>
                                “It is because he is a nerd and a sap.” Lamia said.<br><br>
                                Wren froze, then looked up and around. She was standing right behind him.<br><br>
                                “I cannot stay.” Lamia bent down and kissed his cheek before taking the seat next to him. “But when I saw Wren, I thought it would be nice to meet his friends.”<br><br>
                                Wren's mind was suddenly consumed by the rule that forbade kisses.<br><br>
                                Introductions were made, then Lamia looked at Moneta who shifted uncomfortably.<br><br>
                                “You work at the Foreign Cut, right?” Moneta nodded uncertainly and Lamia gestured at Wren, “Do I have you to thank for this?”<br><br>
                                Another nod.<br><br>
                                “Then thank you, truly.” Lamia smiled genuinely at her, a surprising drop of the usual mask, “Would you mind telling Wren your schedule? I plan on buying some new outfits and you clearly know what you are doing.”<br><br>
                                “Yeah? Of course.” Moneta smiled back, and Wren thought it was partly in relief.<br><br>
                                “Okay, I will see you there some time. Sorry but I cannot stay.” Lamia stood and placed a hand on his shoulder, “I would like to do this properly and get to know you both. Especially you, Brawne. Are you still okay for tonight at my place Wren?”<br><br>
                                “Of course.” He said and placed his hand on hers, giving it a gentle squeeze before she left. He was very startled to find out that the mystery location was Lamia's place. He also still needed directions.<br><br>
                                There were only three of them once again. It was getting busier, and people were everywhere. Wren realised that this would have been a terrible place to tell his friend about the fake relationship.<br><br>
                                Brawne was giving him a look.<br><br>
                                “What?” Wren asked.<br><br>
                                “Dude, she is so out of your league. I can't believe she asked you out.” They were not serious, but Wren felt like a lead weight had settled in his stomach.<br><br>
                                He knew it was true. Lamia was out of his league. She was only with him because they were fake dating. It had not mattered a few hours ago. Now it mattered to him a lot.<br><br>
                                Moneta must have sensed something was up with him because she glared at Brawne.<br><br>
                                “Ignore them, Wren.” She said, “Like, you look good enough to be on anyone's arm, now. Yeah, given what I've seen twice now you're fine in the other department, too.”<br><br>
                                It was kind of her to say so, but she did not have all the information. Wren forced himself to sit up straighter and smile.<br><br>
                                “I guess we had better exchange numbers.” He said to Moneta, “Then you can text me your work schedule later.”<br><br>
                                From there the conversation finally moved away from Wren's love life. Moneta was bemoaning her English assignment.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, I don't get this romantic era poetry. How does a poem in which the lovers die at the end contain a, like, positive romantic message?” Wren had no idea. It was not his area of expertise.<br><br>
                                “You're asking the wrong questions, dude.” However, it was Brawne's, “Saying they died doesn't mean anything. Go back, what killed them?”<br><br>
                                “A guy killed them.” She said.<br><br>
                                “Okay, how did he kill them?” Brawne asked.<br><br>
                                “Just by talking. Yeah, he reveals their lies to everyone else, and they die from the shame.” Moneta said.<br><br>
                                “What were they lying about?” Brawne asked.<br><br>
                                “Their relationship. They, like, completely exited reality to live in a kind of love bubble.” She replied.<br><br>
                                Brawne gave a short laugh and sighed.
                                “Dude, I knew it was going to be 'The Naga'. It's always the fucking Naga. Okay, thing is their love was real. So, give it a minute and think about the pieces you have. Try step away from any one thing being good or bad and see what you can put together.”<br><br>
                                Moneta was staring at the table, frowning.<br><br>
                                “Yeah, like, they really did love each other.” She talked slowly while mentally reaching for something. “Like, what they had wasn't really bad. They weren't hurting anyone. It was just a fantasy. The fantasy was too big. The guy spoke the truth. So, truth destroys fantasy, but it kills them, too. Because they had too much fantasy. But they were killed by too much truth…”<br><br>
                                Wren exchanged glanced with Brawne. They were smiling to themself in a way that Wren knew meant that this was going exactly where they wanted.<br><br>
                                “But!” She had something now and spoke with real excitement, “Like, the love was real! It only disappeared because they did. They had too much fantasy, then too much truth. The author is saying that for love to flourish you need the right balance of truth and fantasy! Yeah! Like, love is the marriage and balance of two individually destructive forces!”<br><br>
                                Moneta finally looked up, grinning. Brawne raised a hand and Moneta high fived them.<br><br>
                                “Brawne is kind of a genius when it comes to this stuff.” Wren said, “They've read a lot of the romantic poets' works many times over.”<br><br>
                                “Damn right. I'm not so into the longer ones about love, though.” Brawne said, “I like the odes and sonnets about transience and such. Stuff like 'Ode to a Shrike'.”<br><br>
                                Wren finally felt like he could extract himself politely and they let him go. Moneta promised to send him her work schedule and Brawne made Wren promise he would keep them in the loop more.<br><br>
                                Along the way home he texted Lamia and asked her for her address. She sent it and he was left to wonder what to do with his newfound feelings. They went completely against the agreement with Lamia.<br><br>
                                Wind rustled the trees and brought a sudden sharp cold. Most of the people walking shivered and closed their jackets. He did not notice.<br><br>
                                Wren wondered for a moment if anything could happen. He could not try anything so in the end, there was no decision to be made. He would proceed exactly as originally intended. Everything until then had been done with the agreement in mind and there was no reason it could not stay that way.<br><br>
