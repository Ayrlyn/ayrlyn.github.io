                                The next day was similar. Wren attended his lectures and then met Lamia. This time they went out for coffee together before walking together in public spaces. They got to know each other, she was studying veterinary science, he philosophy. It might come up if they were ever more than just seen together.<br><br>
                                “You really are a nerd.” She said, there was maybe the barest hint of warmth in there.
                                Lamia Keast's birthday was the thirty-first of November, that was two months away so Wren would need to remember it. Her favourite band, Ill Omen. Hobbies, video games, bird watching, and building models. Best friend's name, Artemis. Ambition, to be a vet.<br><br>
                                “You should have figured that one out already.” Her voice was mildly amused.<br><br>
                                “Better safe than sorry.” He replied, “It's a bad look if I get something basic wrong about my girlfriend-"<br><br>
                                “Fake girlfriend.” She cut Wren off and this time her tone was sharp. That was fair. Part of the agreement here was that he would not overstep his bounds.<br><br>
                                “Fake girlfriend.” He agreed, and they continued.<br><br>
                                Wren Severn's birthday was the ninth of July. Favourite band, Normandy Palace. Hobbies, dancing, cycling and hiking. Best friend's name, Brawne. Ambition, to be an author.<br><br>
                                “So how many books have you written?” She asked.<br><br>
                                “Just the one.” He admitted.<br><br>
                                “And?”<br><br>
                                “And what?” He had no idea what she was looking for.<br><br>
                                “Is it published?” She asked and he smiled wryly.<br><br>
                                “Sadly not. I've sent it out to various agencies but no luck so far.” Just a string of formulaic rejection letters.<br><br>
                                “Sounds like your book sucks. What is it called?” That one actually stung a little.<br><br>
                                “What does it matter?” He bit back a little more sharply than intended.<br><br>
                                “Do not be a bitch about it. What is it called?” He sighed. She was right of course.<br><br>
                                “The Flower and the Flame.”<br><br>
                                “Romance. Figures.” The would-be author could feel her rolling her eyes.<br><br>
                                “It's science fiction.” He said and wondered, not for the first time, if he should change the title.<br><br>
                                “Change the title.” Came the unhesitating response and Wren smiled to himself, “So what now? Will you give up?”<br><br>
                                “No.” He said, “I think it's decent. Rejection is just part of the process, and I’ll get there eventually.”<br><br>
                                “Good, you should keep trying.” He turned his head in surprise and was met with that incredible blue gaze, “I do not want a boyfriend who gives up so easily.”<br><br>
                                “Fake boyfriend.” Lamia's fake boyfriend corrected her and was rewarded with a rare smile.<br><br>
                                “See? I knew you were perfect, nerd.” This time, he was certain she sounded affectionate.<br><br>
                                Wren had known Lamia for only two days, and he found that he liked her. She was intelligent with a sharp wit and an even sharper tongue. He vaguely hoped they could be friends when everything was over, but it seemed unlikely. A fake relationship necessitated a fake breakup. A pity but it was what it was.
                                Lamia's next plan was to head a little way into town for ice cream. It was a nice day, and they left campus hand in hand. People were still glancing their way, openly curious.<br><br>
                                “We are not meeting after class tomorrow.” Lamia said and to Wren's surprise, he was a little disappointed.<br><br>
                                “I have things to do.” She continued, “So we are going out tomorrow evening instead. Dinner or movie, which do you think?”<br><br>
                                “Movie would be good if there's a big new release, lots of people to see us.” He responded, “But it can always look like friends hanging out. Dinner can too, but dressing nicely solves that issue.”<br><br>
                                “Dinner it is. Do you know Qué Bonita?” He shook his head, and she continued. “Look it up, get us a table for seven.”<br><br>
                                Leaving the university campus, they strolled along one of the flower-lined streets. The true skyscrapers started further towards the city centre so between the trees and smaller buildings, it was like they were somewhere other than the nation's capital.<br><br>
                                The ice-cream place was relatively new and very popular. Wren had been there before, and it definitely deserved its reputation. It looked like a lot of students were out to try it, but that would have been why Lamia chose the place.<br><br>
                                “Hey, the ice-bitch has a heart after all. Aren't they a cute couple?” Wren's teeth were immediately on edge.<br><br>
                                He looked over at the speaker. A guy was standing, arms folded, glaring at them. He seemed to be part of a group who at least seemed embarrassed to be there. He turned to Lamia. She was looking at this newcomer with the same neutral expression she always had.<br><br>
                                “What the fuck? You are seriously going to tell me this,” Their antagonist gestured at Wren, “Little shit is better for you than I am?”<br><br>
                                “That is correct.” Lamia's tone was cool, no more or less interested than she ever was.<br><br>
                                “What in Grace? Look at him!” Wren flinched. He might not have except for Lamia's comments when they first met. He did not think he was that bad looking, but there was certainly a pattern developing.<br><br>
                                “Come on Lamia, you said I was handsome.” The idiot started to walk towards them.<br><br>
                                “You are.” Same cool tone.<br><br>
                                “You said I was smart.” Aggression became whinging.<br><br>
                                “You are.” Wren was sure he was not, but he was feeling very biased right then.<br><br>
                                “Then what is wrong with me?” He was back to sounding accusatory and defensive at the same time. “What does he have that I don't? He's going to be your knight, seriously?” <br><br>
                                “Hah!” Wren's outburst had been completely involuntary. The guy rounded on him, face darkening.<br><br>
                                “What?” He demanded.<br><br>
                                “You think Lamia needs a knight? Seriously? You think Lamia needs a knight.” Lamia's not-boyfriend shook his head, “Lamia is the knight you idiot.”<br><br>
                                “What, so you're the princess you little bitch?” The guy snarled and Wren wanted to look to the sky for strength. There was no way Lamia had called this guy smart.<br><br>
                                “Sure, if it helps. I'm the princess. Or sometimes I'm the squire, or another knight.” He took a risk, letting go of Lamia's hand and putting his arm around her waist. She stiffened for a moment before relaxing and returning the gesture.<br><br>
                                “Lamia is the knight. Sometimes she is the queen, and always I'm just lucky to be here.” Wren hoped that was okay, “Point is, we each have battles. I fight with her. She fights with me.”<br><br>
                                “It is not complicated. You want to know why I would not date you, Nyle? You are not Wren.” She tightened her hold on him to emphasise the point, and he felt something strange deep in his chest for a fleeting instant. For his part Nyle looked angrier, and then he just deflated and looked kind of sad.<br><br>
                                “You're such a snake.” There was no heat in it, and he turned and slouched back to his friends. They had stayed away for the whole thing. Some were clearly trying to console him, but one looked apologetically their way and mouthed 'sorry'.<br><br>
                                Wren let go of Lamia's waist and looked around. Quite a few people had been watching the show and now were hurriedly looking anywhere else and pretending otherwise. The fake couple resumed waiting in the queue, standing side by side, holding hands as always.<br><br>
                                “You really told that guy he was smart?” Wren had to know.<br><br>
                                “Academically, he is. Elsewhere, well, you saw for yourself.” He certainly had. “Nyle and I had a group project once. He decided that our interactions during it meant something. He gathered all his friends, bought a bouquet of flowers, and made a grand display of asking me to be his girlfriend.”<br><br>
                                It was obvious how that had turned out.<br><br>
                                “How did you end up calling him handsome?” That did not fit into the academic project angle.<br><br>
                                “At the beginning of the same project we were required to stand up and say one nice thing about the other members. He is handsome so I said so.” Wren still did not understand how Lamia maintained such a cool disposition in the face of all this.<br><br>
                                Wren knew Nyle was not handsome. Then he had to admit that maybe he was. Maybe.<br><br>
                                “Where did that little speech of yours come from?” She asked and he shrugged.<br><br>
                                “I didn't exactly have one prepared. I wasn't expecting that facing spurned suitors was on the timetable today. That knight comment was just so stupid. I reacted and everything after that just kind of came to me.” Wren hoped what he had said was okay.<br><br>
                                Wren turned to look at Lamia and caught… Something in her expression. Something completely unfamiliar. Whatever it was, it left as quickly as it came, replaced by the usual mask.<br><br>
                                “Great, so you are a sap and a nerd. What a loser.” Wren grinned.
